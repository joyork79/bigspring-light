Ignite North East has revealed the 15 early-stage start-ups that will be participating in its 2022 pre-accelerator programme, which kicks off in early February.

As part of the five-month programme, participants receive £10,000 in equity-free funding, weekly workshops, access to a global network of mentors and investors and £250,000 in credits from partners to support their business.

Funded by North of Tyne Combine Authority (NTCA), the programme is designed to help early-stage entrepreneurs who use innovative and disruptive technologies to build their business and achieve international success through mentorship, investor access, advice and support.

Cllr Nick Forbes said “NTCA is delighted to support Ignite with this programme which will grow the pipeline of potential new start up organisations in the digital and tech sectors across the North of Tyne.”

“The programme addresses the importance of a vibrant and high potential start-up scene and contributes significantly towards our wider plans to grow the digital economy here. It also supports the work of Ignite in developing a thriving digital sector as a part of this wider programme.”

“We welcome the scale and diversity of the applications received to date and the shortlisted entries provide a fantastic example of that”

“Already, the programme is demonstrating that there is huge potential for growth in an already strong sector for the region, and I look forward to following the stories of these startups as they develop and grow.”

This year’s programme saw high levels of interest, with 112 startups coming through the recruitment process making the selection process extremely competitive.

Jo York, programme director of Ignite NE, remarked: “The quality of applications for this programme was exceptionally high, making it a difficult process to select the top 15 early-stage businesses for this year’s cohort.”

“It was inspiring to see that whilst the country has been locked-down and furloughed, the entrepreneurs of the North East have quietly been building and thinking intelligently about the future. If this is anything thing to go by, there’s a very exciting future for North East’s entrepreneurial community over the next few years.”

“The content and the structure has been designed to make it as accessibility to as many founders as possible. We have a mixture of technical and non-technical founders, solo-founders and teams. Notably 40% of the teams have female founders.”

There is a wide range of sectors represented in the cohort, including e-sports, metaverse, healthtech, femtech, wearables, micro-vehicles, education and some of the teams are exploring technologies such as AI, Blockchain, NFTs

David Dunn, Digital Catapult North East & Tees Valley added “We are very excited that these 15 companies have been selected for the programme, this is a strong indicator that there is significant potential to grow the tech ecosystem in the North of Tyne. We look forward to working with Ignite to find more tech founders in the area through our outreach programme”.

##### Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

<dl>
<dt>Definition list</dt>
<dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

<dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
<dd>Does _not_ work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

##### Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables | Are | Cool |
| --- | :---: | ---: |
| col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is | centered | $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat | $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less | Pretty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Still | renders | nicely |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
